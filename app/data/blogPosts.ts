      <h2>Introduction to Price Action Trading</h2>
      <p>Price action trading is one of the purest forms of trading, focusing solely on the movement of price across time. Unlike indicator-based strategies, price action trading relies on your ability to read and interpret raw price movements on a chart.</p>

      <h2>Key Components of Price Action Trading</h2>
      <p>To become proficient in price action trading, you need to understand several key components:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Support and Resistance</h3>
      <p>These are price levels where the market has historically shown a tendency to reverse direction. Support acts as a floor, while resistance acts as a ceiling.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Trend Analysis</h3>
      <p>Understanding the overall direction of the market is crucial. Look for higher highs and higher lows in uptrends, and lower highs and lower lows in downtrends.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Candlestick Patterns</h3>
      <p>Japanese candlesticks provide valuable insights into market psychology. Key patterns include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Doji - indicating market indecision</li>
        <li>Engulfing patterns - showing potential reversal points</li>
        <li>Pin bars - highlighting rejection of certain price levels</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Price action trading is a skill that develops with time and practice. Focus on understanding market structure, practicing pattern recognition, and maintaining strict risk management. Remember, simplicity is often the key to consistent trading success.</p>
